--==Structure of eternalnomad savefiles==--

1.: The player savefile

A player figure is defined by a 4x4 field:

1234
5678
ABCD
EFGH

The top row is the hat.
The second row is the head.
The third row is arms and body.
The bottom row are the legs.

For every animation, there need to be four player figures.
The required animations are:

Idle Right
Idle Left
Walk Right
Walk Left

Look at player.sve for an example.

2.: The world savefile

The top line contains the seed.
Then there are lines with the formatting:

material:y:x

The y/x positions of the generated world are overwritten with the material values.
